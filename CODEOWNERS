# This is a sample CODEOWNERS file that assigns code owners to different parts of the project.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# More info: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
*       @yourusername @yourteam

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches JavaScript files, only these owners will be requested to review.
*.java  @yourusername @yourteam/java

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer.
docs/  docs@example.com

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should be identified in the format @org/team-name.
# For example:
# @octocat/engineering @octocat/design

# You can also specify a single code owner for a specific file or directory.
# For example, if you have a file that only John should be responsible for:
# /path/to/file.java @johndoe

# You can also use glob patterns to match multiple files or directories.
# For example, to match all files in the 'config' directory:
# /config/ @yourusername @yourteam/infrastructure

# You can also use negative patterns to exclude certain files or directories.
# For example, to exclude all files in the 'test' directory:
# /test/
